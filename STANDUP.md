## 2026-06-04 Builder
- **Done:** Cleared the entire Builder queue — all P0, P1 and P2 tasks (14 total), each committed + pushed to origin/main and set to `review` on the board:
  - B-1 Onboarding: 3-step "How to play" modal (first-login, reopenable, RTL, i18n).
  - B-2 Points breakdown: click the +pts pill → modal showing base × stage × odds = total (matches server formula exactly).
  - B-3 Uptime: `/health` (+`/healthz`) endpoint (200/ok, 503 on DB down, rate-limit-free) + `scripts/UPTIME.md` for UptimeRobot.
  - B-4 DB backup: **found existing cp-based backup is NOT WAL-safe** (data-loss risk). Added WAL-consistent `scripts/backup-db.js` (online backup API + integrity check + gzip + rotate) on a daily agent cron.
  - B-5 Notification badge: red unpredicted-count badge on the Predictions tab.
  - B-6 Loading skeleton on first match load.
  - B-7 Auto-fetch odds daily (existing scheduler only fetched scores).
  - B-8 Edit knockout names: UI already existed — **fixed missing admin auth on `update-teams` + `odds` endpoints** (was open to anyone).
  - B-9 Graceful 404/500 error pages (HTML for browser, JSON for /api).
  - B-10 Rate limiting already worked; added Retry-After + X-RateLimit headers.
  - B-11 Animated score reveal. B-12 Confetti on exact prediction. B-13 Dark/light theme toggle.
  - B-31 Shareable prediction card API (`/api/card/:playerId` → SVG or JSON); refactored leaderboard into shared `computeBoard()`.
- **Blocked:** Two items need operator (cannot touch `/opt` as agent): (1) set up the external UptimeRobot monitor → TG, (2) switch root `/opt/worldcup/backup.sh` from `cp` to the WAL-safe method. Both documented.
- **Next:** Queue empty. Awaiting review/merge of the `review`-state tasks; Growth queue is unassigned to Builder.
